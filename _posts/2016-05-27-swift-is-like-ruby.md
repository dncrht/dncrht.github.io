Few weeks ago I started learning a bit of Swift and iOS development.
Swift is a really nice language and easy to pick up if you already know JavaScript, Ruby, Python et al.

I've adapted a [cheat sheet](https://nilhcem.github.io/swift-is-like-kotlin/) I found for Swift 2 & [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) to Ruby.
Ruby is a _polyhedric_ language, with several ways to do things. I've taken my preferred answer to some equivalences, YMMV!

Have a look at [Swift is like Ruby](https://swift-is-like-ruby.github.io/).
