I've recently become an iPhone user, after 7 years with Android.

I migrated data and apps manually, no big deal. However I had a significant amount
of notes I wanted to keep. I always liked OS X's Notes.app and how well it syncs
with iPhone, something I really missed with Android.

My notes were created with Samsung's default notes app, called _S Memo_.
Notes are stored in the phone's internal memory, and can also be exported to the external
SD card easily.

Each note is in fact an .snb file. These files are in fact zip files containing
other files.
